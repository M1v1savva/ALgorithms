These are most of templates of algorithms I have been using in competetive programming. If you do not know what competetive 
programming is check out this website(because it is legendary): https://codeforces.com

This will be a true act of heroism if you manage to understand my code, because I wrote it primarly for personal usage(variable names 
a la a, b, t, p and so on). Still, all this code is working 100% and there is quite a lot of interesting stuff, so I think 
it is worth sharing.

I am planning to keep refactoring and adding some new stuff to it, so stay tuned!
