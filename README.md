These are the algorithms templates I have been using throughout my competetive [programming career](https://codeforces.com/profile/M1v1savva1601).

The code was intended for my personal usage so the code is not necessarily understandable. However, it is neat and fully functional, each of those templates was tested in various competitions. 

For now I took a break from competitions and focus on other stuff, however, if I return I will be refactor these templates for more convenient usage.
